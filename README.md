Microsoft Excel (2016 or newer recommended)
Sample sales data (or import your own dataset)

Data Preparation
Collect sales data, including columns for:
City
State
Total Sales
Units Sold
Product-wise sales quantity
Clean and organize the data to ensure consistency and remove any missing or duplicate entries.

Dashboard Creation Steps
Step 1: Set Up the Excel Workbook
Open a new workbook in Excel.
Create sheets as needed, such as "Data" for raw data and "Dashboard" for visualizations.
Step 2: Import Data
Copy and paste your prepared data into the "Data" sheet.
Format the data as a table for easier reference and better data management.
Step 3: Create Individual Visualizations
Sales Summary (Top Section): Use Data Bars and Gauge Charts (circular charts) to display overall sales, units, and city count.
City-Wise Sales Chart: Insert a Line Chart to show sales trends across different cities.
State-Wise Sales Map: Use Excel's built-in Map Chart feature to create a geographical sales distribution by state.
Product-Wise Units Ranking: Use a Bar Chart to display the units sold per product in descending order.
Step 4: Arrange and Format Dashboard
Position each chart and metric in a clean, visually appealing layout.
Use background colors, borders, and icons for a professional look.
Adjust chart colors and styles to match the theme (e.g., blue and orange for Amazon branding).
Add labels and titles to each chart for easy understanding.

Final Dashboard
The final dashboard should look similar to the image below.
